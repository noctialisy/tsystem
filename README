A collection of tools and scripts to use for maintenance tasks in windows.
The core library is based on python 3.12 and leverages basic Windows functionalities like DISM, SFC, Reg files and other Windows system components. 

Requirements:
    - FFMPEG for some video functionalities
    - MAKE and pyinstaller to build the EXE from the python code
    - You can run from any directory but to use the script you need the script, vcredist and logs directories in the same folder as the software

Configuration:
    - Install Python
    - Install make
    - Run "make prepare_venv" to prepare the venv in python
    - Run "make compile" to create the tsystem.exe to use in your system
    - Run tsystem.py / tsystem.exe supplying the arguments for the functions

Argument supported:
    - system_clean
    - system_clean_set
    - system_clean_event
    - system_scan
    - system_test
    - choco_install
    - choco_remove
    - netframework_install
    - netframework_build
    - video_merge
    - stream_markers_convert

Future steps:
    This project has grown in time and will probably have a GUI in the future as more functions are added.
