A collection of tools and scripts to use for maintenance tasks in windows.

The core library is based on python 3.12 and leverages basic Windows functionalities like DISM, SFC, Reg files and other Windows system components. 

Configuration:
    - Install Python
    - Install pyinstaller for building tsystem.py if you want to use it as an exe (suggested)
    - Run tsystem.py / tsystem.exe supplying the arguments for the functions

Argument supported:
    - system_clean
    - system_clean_set
    - system_clean_full
    - system_scan
    - system_test
    - netframework_install
    - netframework_build

Future steps:
    This project has grown in time and will probably have a GUI in the future as more functions are added.
