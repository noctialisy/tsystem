A collection of tools and scripts to use for maintenance tasks in windows.

The scripts are mostly written in PowerShell and can be used without any additional installation, only some development functionalities use Python, but those are still being tested.

Configuration:
    To execute the scripts you need:
        PS Console as admin
        Script execution configuration by running the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"
        Add the "modules" folder to windows path variable so the commands are available from anywhere


Future steps:
    This project has grown in time and will probably have a GUI in the future as more functions are added.
